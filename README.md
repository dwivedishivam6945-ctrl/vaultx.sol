# VeriTrust

## Project Description
**VeriTrust** is a decentralized trust management system built on the Ethereum blockchain.  
It allows users to register their identity and receive trust verifications from others — creating a transparent, community-driven reputation layer.

## Project Vision
To create a **trustless, transparent, and decentralized reputation network** where trust is earned and verified through blockchain consensus rather than centralized authorities.

## Key Features
- **User Registration:** Anyone can create a verified profile on-chain.
- **Trust Scoring:** Users can increase others’ trust scores based on positive interactions.
- **Transparency:** All trust changes are recorded immutably on the blockchain.
- **Community Driven:** Trust is managed collectively, not by centralized intermediaries.

## Future Scope
- Integration with **Web3 identity systems** (e.g., ENS, Soulbound Tokens).
- **Decentralized governance** for setting trust rules.
- **AI-based analysis** of reputation metrics.
- Expansion into **cross-chain verification** and real-world credential linking.
